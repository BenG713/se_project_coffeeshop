# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. It consists of five separate pages and a footer.  

## Project features
- Semantic HTMLs (Writing the elements in simplest form)
- Flexbox (Allowing said element to be more flexibly positioned)
- Positioning (Structuring each element in an aesthetically pleasing way)
- Flat BEM file structure (Organzing and dividing files so one's head does not explode)
- A custom form (Allowing potential customers to reserve a table right on the website)
- CSS animation and transform (To make the site more visually engaging)

## Plan on improving the project

More pictures from the actual coffee shop, especially of the various items for sale, would give the potential visitor a clearer view of what the establishment has to offer. It will also provide a more visceral response, which is most effective at enticing new customers. When people see the real thing for want of a better term, they can more easily see themselves partaking in said "thing." 

Same goes for videos in the Recipes Section. Footage of the baked goods being baked, coffee being brewed, etc. will more accurately portray what happens at Specialty Coffee and invite the potential visitor in.
